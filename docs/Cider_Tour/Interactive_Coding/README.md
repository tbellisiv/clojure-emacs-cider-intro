# Interactive Development

In the previous section we worked directly within the CIDER REPL buffer to run Clojure code. CIDER also provides integrated access to the REPL while working within buffers of Clojure source files. 

The integrated access enables an interactive style of development where a developer can edit code, update the state and/or code of the running application in the REPL, run tests and observe the changes. All of this can be accomplished without switching between buffers.

The integrated access to the REPL is provided through the `cider-mode` minor mode that was introduced in [Cider Mode](../Cider_Mode/README.md).

In this section we will explore CIDER's feature set that enables interactive development.
