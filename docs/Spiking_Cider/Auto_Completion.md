# Auto-Completion

Out of the box, CIDER provides support for code completion by leveraging Emacs' standard completion facility. CIDER also supports the popular [Company Mode](http://company-mode.github.io/) which provides a more interactive and integrated code completion mechanism.

## Configuring Company Mode

To configure company-mode in Emacs do the following:

1. Install the company-mode package: `M-x package-install company [RET]`
