# Presentation Materials

All of the accompanying materials (code, Emacs configuration files) are located within the [GitHub](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro) project for this GitBook. In order to work through the exercises and get the most out of this presentation, it is recommended that you clone the GitHub project:

```git clone https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro.git```


### Clojure Code

The Clojure code and projects referenced in this presentation are located in the ```code/clj``` sub-directory of the GitHub project.


### Emacs Initialization Files

For the majority of the presentation a base Emacs init file ([init.el](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro/blob/master/code/elisp/init_file/00_base/init.el)) will be used for the hands-on exercises. In [Spiking CIDER](Spiking Cider/README.md) we will progressively update the base init file to enhance the CIDER development experience.

The base [init.el](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro/blob/master/code/elisp/init_file/00_base/init.el) contains the minimal configuration necessary to enable installation of Emacs packages such as CIDER.

Successive versions of the init file are located in the ```code/elisp/init_file``` sub-directory of the GitHub project. Each is stored in a sub-directory that has a numeric prefix indicating the version ('00' being the base version) and a short description. The sub-directory containing the base version used in this chapter is ```00_base```.
